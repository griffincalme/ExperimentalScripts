Some things I've written to solve little problems or out of curiosity

-----

FileEncryptor.py

Terminal/cmd file encryptor (AES)

This is just a toy/ thing I was messing with

Requires:

Python 3 PyCrypto

Simply run in the command prompt/terminal and follow instructions

Use E to encrypt, D to decrypt. Make sure to type the complete file path. However, if the file to be encrypted is in the same folder as FileEncryptor.py, it is only necessary to type the filename.
