#FileEncryptor.py

Terminal/cmd file encryptor (AES)

This is just a toy/ thing I was messing with

Requires:

Python 3 PyCrypto

Simply run in the command prompt/terminal and follow instructions

Use E to encrypt, D to decrypt. Make sure to type the complete file path. However, if the file to be encrypted is in the same folder as FileEncryptor.py, it is only necessary to type the filename.

#CoinFlip.py

Returns heads or tails with equal probability when the function is called

-----

#MonteCarloChildren.py

Runs a Monte Carlo simulation to determine the probability that at least one child will be a girl.
The function accepts numbers of simulation runs and the number of children you plan on having.

Basically, it validates 1 - (Pr * n)
